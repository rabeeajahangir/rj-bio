Purpose of the Website:
An intro to the projects I have worked on so far. I will be updating this with my projects to give my employer's a glimpse of the skills I have acquired with this bootcamp.

Website Features:
The website has navigational tools to browse to different sections of a website.

Its colors scheme has been selected to attract employers.

The largest displayed project is the first project we completed.

The website has been made to be responsive for different screen sizes.

The website contains full contact details in the footer.
